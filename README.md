This was created to demonstrate learnings from the Code Institute software development course and marks the second of four milestone projects to be created. It is to showcase HTML, CSS,Javascript and UX by way of an interactive front end website.

## The Rabbit Hole

The Rabbit Hole website is a fully responsive website designed to primarily showcase the site owners knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript. It was inspired by old school gaming centered around the 'hacker' theme and the concept of 'Easter Eggs' as well as CLI.
It's core 'Easter Egg' is the key listener for the 'Konami Code' and the sites layout is inspired by games such as Uplink and hacknet. The site is deliberatley designed to be ominous and intriguing by replicating the "Follow the white rabbit" scene from The Matrix. 
The 'Konami code' is infamously known as &#8593; &#8593; &#8595; &#8595; &#8592; &#8594; &#8592; &#8594; B A.   
For those unfamiliar with the Konami Code, the site guides you through a series of riddles of which the answer to each riddles corresponds to a value of the Konami code.   
As such, the answers to the riddles, in order are: **up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a**.   

For the site owner, it’s purpose is to provide a fun, unique and interactive way of displaying his CV.  

A live version of the site can be viewed [here](https://logisticbravo.github.io/Milestone_project_2-The-Rabbit-Hole).

## User Experience (UX)
### User stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to have an interactive fun experience.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to receive feedback on my progression. 
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be redirected to the landing page if I navigate to a wrong or broken link.
#### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to discover any and all easter eggs.
#### Frequent User Goals
* As a Frequent User, I want to access the site across a range of devices.
* As a Frequent user, I want to see if any additional content or features have been added. 

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The site uses the following 6 colours primarily.   
![image](mdassets/mdimages/colors.png)
* Blue - rgb(0,150,199) #0096C7
* Yellow - rgb(255,236,137) #FFEC89
* Pink - rgb(215,72,148) #D74894
* Orange - rgb(213,135,71) #D58747
* Green - rgb(96,155,85) #609B55
* Cyan - rgb(77,189,174) #4DBDAE
* White - rgb(255,255,255) #FFFFFF

In places it uses an alternate Green - rgb(3,160,98) #03A062
#### Typography
* [The Roboto font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) is used on all elements throughout the site with monospace as a fall back in case of errors in loading the font. Roboto is a clean and stylish popular choice as Androids default font and so fits the target market of those that are more ‘tech’ orientated and gives a modern CLI esque take on the font. 
* [VT323](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323) is used as an additional theme choice on the CV page and is a fitting nod to many an old school game. 
#### Imagery
The site uses only one image which is that of the site owner and can be found on the CV page.   
If so inclined, the ASCII formatted name of the  site owner on the CV page could also be classified as an image. 
#### Wireframes
![wireframeimage](mdassets/mdimages/wireframe.png)   

Full Wireframes drawn up using Figma can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/mL9JotMF4MYMdmlnQvNUHA/Milestone-Project-2-The-Rabbit-Hole?node-id=0%3A1)

## Features
* The index page features a flashing cursor animation.
* The site uses a Typewritter effect function to type everything to the screen.
* The site uses a rolladex animation on the ASCII numbers before loading the CV page which when locked in turn green.
* The CV page offers 3 themes.   
* The site has a key listener in place so as to capture and implement an effect from the correct key strokes being input.
* The site has a number of "Easter Eggs" throughout.    
   
![IDE Theme](mdassets/mdimages/idetheme.png)    
* The site provides feedback on the users progress by way of a CLI type effect. 
* Custom 404 page should the user navigate to a non-existant link which will automatically be redirected to home.   
This can be tested [here](https://logisticbravo.github.io/Milestone_project_2-The-Rabbit-Hole/404.html)

<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
    <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
        src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue"
        alt="Valid CSS!" />
    </a>

<a href="https://validator.w3.org/">
<img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
        src="https://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-html401-blue"
        alt="Valid HTML!" />
